## Overview

boringproxy is a combination of a reverse proxy and a tunnel manager.

What that means is if you have a self-hosted web service (Nextcloud, Emby, Jellyfin, etherpad, personal website, etc.) running on a private network (such as behind a NAT at home), boringproxy aims to provide the easiest way to securely (i.e. HTTPS and optional password-protection) expose that server to the internet, so you can access it from anywhere.

### Features

 - 100% free and open source under the MIT license.
 - Designed from the ground up with self-hosters in mind.
 - No more port forwarding, NAT traversal, firewall rules, HTTPS certificate management, etc etc. Let boringproxy handle it all for you.
 - No config files. Seriously, none. It has nice defaults and the few knobs are easily adjusted with simple CLI parameters.
 - Lightning fast web GUI for managing tunnels from one central place. It even works great on mobile browsers.
 - Fully configurable through a HTTP API.
 - The client software works on Linux, Windows, Mac, and ARM (i.e. Raspberry Pi and Android).
 - Ships as single executable which contains both the server and client.
 - SSH under the hood. You can use a standard SSH client if you prefer.
 - End-to-end encryption (since version 0.4.0). Choose whether to terminate TLS at the server, client, or your application. All handled seamlessly with Let's Encrypt integration.
